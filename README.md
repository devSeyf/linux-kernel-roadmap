# Linux Kernel Roadmap

ðŸ“Œ I'm updating this basic Linux kernel roadmap step by step.

The original roadmap is from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/smalinux/md).

I highly recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvZpy6-mqOY) for more context.

##  Step 1: Learn Linux and Linux Systems

Before diving into the kernel, it's essential to be comfortable using Linux.

You can start with **any Linux distribution** â€” Debian, Arch, Ubuntu, or Linux Mint. Just pick one and start exploring!

##  Step 2: Learn the C Programming Language

To understand how applications and the kernel itself work, you need to learn C â€” the foundational language of Linux.
